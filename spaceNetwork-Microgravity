\section*{🛰️ Space-Based Internet}

Space-based internet uses satellite constellations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to deliver global connectivity. 

It aims to provide high-speed, low-latency internet access to remote and underserved areas. 

Operates without ground cables, relying on satellites that act as wireless routers in space. 

\textbf{Data transmission path:} User antenna $\rightarrow$ Satellite $\rightarrow$ Satellite $\rightarrow$ Ground hub. 

Signals travel in milliseconds through laser inter-satellite links (ISLs) and ground stations.

\subsection*{Major Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Starlink (SpaceX)
    \item OneWeb
    \item Amazon’s Project Kuiper
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provides coverage to rural, oceanic, and disaster-affected regions.
    \item Enables education, healthcare, and communication in remote zones.
    \item Reduces dependence on fiber-optic infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Orbital congestion and space debris risk.
    \item High operational cost and maintenance.
    \item Signal interference and regulatory issues.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact:} Aims to make global internet access universal, turning connectivity into a basic human right rather than a luxury.

\section*{🌐 Space Networks (TDRS \& LCRD)}

\subsection*{🔸 TDRS – Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System}
Developed and operated by NASA.

A network of geostationary satellites providing real-time communication between spacecraft and Earth.

Ensures continuous coverage for spacecraft like the ISS, Hubble Space Telescope, and other low-orbit missions.

\textbf{Data relay path:} Spacecraft $\rightarrow$ TDRS satellite $\rightarrow$ Ground terminal.

Eliminates the need for spacecraft to wait for direct line-of-sight passes.

Handles telemetry, tracking, command, and data transmission.

Positioned about 35,786 km above Earth in geostationary orbit (GEO).

\subsection*{🔸 LCRD – Laser Communications Relay Demonstration}
A NASA mission testing laser (optical) communication in space.

Uses laser light instead of radio waves to transmit data.

Offers up to 100$\times$ faster data rates compared to traditional RF systems.

Provides smaller antennas, lower interference, and higher security.

Demonstrates how future missions can send high-resolution data, images, and videos more efficiently.

Helps prepare for deep-space communication systems using optical links.

Combined with TDRS, LCRD represents the evolution toward a high-speed space communication network.

\section*{🌌 Artificial Gravity \& Microgravity}

\subsection*{🔸 Microgravity Effects}
In space, astronauts experience microgravity (near weightlessness).

Long exposure causes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Muscle atrophy (loss of strength)
    \item Bone density reduction
    \item Cardiovascular weakening
    \item Fluid redistribution affecting vision and balance
    \item Disorientation and sleep difficulties
\end{itemize}

These effects pose serious risks for long-duration missions (e.g., Mars).

\subsection*{🔸 Artificial Gravity Concept}

Artificial gravity is produced by centrifugal force from rotation — not real gravity, but an equivalent effect.

\[
a = \omega^2 \times r
\]

\textbf{Where:}
\begin{align*}
a & = \text{artificial gravity} \\
\omega & = \text{angular velocity (rotation speed)} \\
r & = \text{radius of rotation}
\end{align*}

Increasing radius allows slower, more comfortable rotation.

Too-fast rotation causes Coriolis effects (dizziness or nausea).

\subsection*{🔸 Design Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rotating spacecraft:} The entire spacecraft spins slowly.
    \item \textbf{Centrifugal habitats:} Only a ring or section spins to generate gravity.
    \item \textbf{Tethered systems:} Two modules connected by a cable rotate around a center of mass.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{🔸 Research \& Development}

NASA, ESA, and JAXA are experimenting with small centrifuges to simulate artificial gravity.

JAXA’s Kibo module aboard the ISS studies partial gravity on biological organisms.

Stanford Torus and O’Neill Cylinder are classic theoretical models for rotating space habitats.

The Lunar Gateway and future Mars missions may integrate artificial gravity modules.

\subsection*{🔸 Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Structural stress from constant rotation.
    \item High energy demand for spin-up and stabilization.
    \item Maintaining balance and orientation control.
    \item Human adaptation to partial or rotating gravity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{🔸 Future Outlook}
Artificial gravity is essential for long-term human survival in space.

It enables healthier, more sustainable missions to Mars and beyond.

It represents a major step toward building livable habitats beyond Earth.
